# object_detection_localization_tensorflow_opensource
Object detection and localization using TensorFlow - open source datasets

This git has examples/tutorials on object detection.  Note by object detection we mean identifying objects (one or more) present in an image and giving information on their location (bounding box).   NOT object detection is whole-image classification (establishing a single label for an image) or segmentation (the composition of an image such as subject/background).
